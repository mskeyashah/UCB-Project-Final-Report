The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot\"\n",

      "📝 Summary: This third entry has only one creature, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past, but not here. Though wasteful of the expensive sets, Fincher's tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic.\n",

      "📝 Summary: The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Amazing Spider-Man 2\n",
      "📝 Summary: Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man.\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Princess Bride\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Princess Bride is ultimately a story of love - of a grandather for his grandson, of Inigo Montoya for his murdered father and between Buttercup and Wesley. The characters are endearing and essential to the plot. The only criticism I have is that it is too male centric as many films and series still are unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Brave\n",
      "📝 Summary: I enjoyed Brave but it wasn't without a few flaws. It was enjoyable sure, and had some good morals and family values. It just seems to lack the \"magic\" I expect from Pixar. Not their worst outing but close to it.\n",

      "📝 Summary: Aladdin is one of Disney’s most adored classics. Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it's the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of the best.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Fantastic Four\n",

A poacher from the past seeks vengeance on the creature (Rade Serbedzija), which breaks free to cause havoc. Despite a good cast, great F/X and lots of action & adventure, the movie's somehow shallow with cardboard thin characters.\n",

      "📝 Summary: A forgettable film, full of problems, and which purges Garfield of the charisma and soul of the original cartoon character. I always enjoy the real versions of animated movies. Like this movie.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Spider-Man 3\n",
      "📝 Summary: Spider-Man 3 represents Sam Raimi's inability to overcome the biggest hurdle of a third movie. Studio interference did not mandate the jazz bar dance scene. It did not have the Green Goblin 2 storyline make absolutely no sense whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Spider-Man\n",
      "📝 Summary: So many Spiderman movies out there but this will always be the original. Though the other ones have better CGI and maybe action sequences, none can match the plot this one has. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire the real MVP!\n",

      "🔸 Title: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n",
      "📝 Summary: I believe that we should call it a modernism show, albeit exhibited in the form of a movie. There are many great predictions hinting to future (it is from 1968 - can you believe it?) innovations throughout the movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Tree of Life\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Tree of Life is an attempt to inject some cosmic wonder into the most mundane American story. A movie that wants to mean more than what is actually telling.\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Man from Earth\n",
      "📝 Summary: A great idea for a movie developed in a witty script. Well done and with a decent cast. Perfect for being played also in the theaters or watched under the blanket at home.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Immortals\n",
      "📝 Summary: Everyone talks about how _Immortals_ is a _300_ ripoff, but I haven't yet seen anyone talk about how it's also a bit of a God of War ripoff. I'm actually quite fond of historically-set mythology films, but the problem with this movie isn't the setting or the genre, it's the motivation behind its being made the way it was. The real motivation behind both these, and of any other studio film, is money. And this movie doesn't give me the vibe that anyone did.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Pay It Forward\n",
      "📝 Summary: This was an inspirational movie, and everybody must see it. Carrying a good social message, the movie slightly lags behind the too much on the emotions. There won't be a problem if you like melodrama.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Big Fish\n",
      "📝 Summary: First time seeing this since probably 2003 in theaters and it's absolutely heartfelt and charming, probably one of Tim Burton's best films. Great performances all around but especially Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney. Really well done. **4.5/5**\n",

      "🔸 Title: Old School\n",
      "📝 Summary: This was the first movie I ever seen with Will Ferrell in it. I thought it was hilarious. The movie ain't really that good, but it's so funny that it doesn't really matter.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Gravity\n",
      "📝 Summary: Alfonso Cuarón is a real titan and Sandra Bullock goes for the Oscar. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish.\n",

      "Movies similar to 'Green Lantern' using KMeans:\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Count of Monte Cristo\n",
      "📝 Summary: Fantastic story given a quite smashing adaptation. Made for around $35 million, Reynolds' film fared OK at the Worldwide box office, taking in around $76 million. Yet far from being a flop, it upped and vanished rather quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Waterworld\n",
      "📝 Summary: Waterworld is directed by Kevin Reynolds and jointly written by David Twohy, Peter Rader and Joss Whedon. It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism\n",
      "📝 Summary: Christopher Lee stars as Count \"Regula\" who returns from the dead. The film is set in Germany in the 1700s. It's very much in the style of an Hammer film, with colourful scenery.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Get Shorty\n",
      "📝 Summary: As good as the book is, I believe the movie improved upon it. The ensemble cast (which includes a few lower echelon stars) is excellent. There is violence, but not with buckets of blood. And of course wit and humor run through it.\n",

      "📝 Summary: 'Toy Story 2' still manages to create the same magic that the original has - which is mightily impressive. It, at least to me, has less humour but what it loses there it makes up for in the premise, which is arguably more interesting when compared to the 1995 film.\n",

      "📝 Summary: The film really tackles the fate of humanity straight on. The story takes you on a journey which is one of the most believable time travel movies of all time. The action scenes are fantastic, with wall to wall fighting, car chases and military maneuvers that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\n",
      "📝 Summary: Under-rated, worthy chapter to the story, with surprisingly provocative ideas and some stellar acting. While this movie admittedly has neither the grit of T1 nor the grand vision or pathos of T2.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Terminator\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Terminator is a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. The effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Terminator Genisys\n",
      "📝 Summary: Some people have said that _Terminator: Genisys_ is disrespectful to its source material (first two films) but I disagree. They took some risks with their casting and it didn’t explode in their face which is nice. A lot of the effects were very visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again. When you mix them up with a plot that doesn't completely make sense, a story that’s just plain not all that great and a lacklustre ending, then you’re lucky to even be coming away with a middle of the road score.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Dawn of the Dead\n",

      "📝 Summary: Halloween II is a worthy entry into one of the most successful horror franchises of all time. Featuring some strong acting, a surreal but accomplished script, an absolutely amazing soundtrack, and a totally absorbing storyline. The bleak, demoralising nature of the film made it painful to watch at times, but it was worth it overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Land of the Dead\n",
      "📝 Summary: Land Of The Dead is directed & written by George A. Romero and it's the fourth film in his Zombie based series of films. It stars Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Eugene Clark & Asia Argento.\n",

      "📝 Summary: I'm not a massive comic book reader/fan and when I watched the first couple of the X-men movies I always wondered how it all begin and this movie do it justice! The actors where great (there no Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen), Kevin Bacon played the baddie very well and was well suited for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: X-Men\n",
      "📝 Summary: The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. Eric Lensherr or Magneto is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: X2\n",
      "📝 Summary: Wolverine was the most interesting thing about the last movie, and this is a surprising instance of a studio realizing audience feedback and basically just made the first Wolverine origin movie. Worth watching for the Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike fight alone.\n",

      "🔸 Title: X-Men: Apocalypse\n",
      "📝 Summary: The CGI was often so bad it was confronting, even in the climax of the film. Apocalypse's plan was plot-hole-y and underdeveloped, and not all of the new characters hit it out of the park. Fassbender and McAvoy are excellent as always.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: X-Men: The Last Stand\n",
      "📝 Summary: Not only is the Phoenix storyline butchered, but the script rewrites the personalities of its key characters. Halle Berry's demand for more screentime basically means she shows up in more scenes. Rogue has also turned into a whiny sidenote.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\n",
      "📝 Summary: It's a good honest Star Trek story, it beats a real emotive heart. Some may decry the lack of blistering space battles, or end of the universe peril scenarios. On its own terms this stands up as one of the better character pieces in the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\n",

      "🔸 Title: Mamma Mia!\n",
      "📝 Summary: To Mamma Mia! then, a movie easily slipping in past Coyote Ugly as the second-worst film I've ever seen (behind The Rocky Horror Picture Show). My eyes. I can't unsee it. I think my brain was trying to reject it, like a foreign object.\n",

      "📝 Summary: This was a first-time watch for me so seeing this fantasy film from 1983 directed by Peter Yates with music by James Horner which is kind of funny because the music kind of reminded me of Star Trek just a little bit. There were two characters that I recognized one being that of Ergo the Magnificent the man that kept changing into different animals but was kind of a bumbling fool.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: J. Edgar\n",
      "📝 Summary: Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a very good performance as the titular character. There aren't, at least for me, any memorable scenes and I wasn't invested in the plot at any point really. It's semi-watchable, but goes on for too long to be passably so.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Titanic\n",
      "📝 Summary: It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film. But socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it!\n",

      "🔸 Title: Wonder Boys\n",
      "📝 Summary: \"Prof. Tripp\" (Michael Douglas) hasn't his troubles to seek. He hasn't been able to follow up on his first novel for almost seven years. The movie shows what can be achieved with a good ensemble cast and a decent script.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Cradle of Life benefits from a larger budget, a new director, and a little less cheese. The first film seemed more influenced by Blade and style Matrix, whereas the sequel takes its cues from Mission: Impossible. Angelina Jolie and Jan de Bont make it feel more grounded and believable.\n",

      "📝 Summary: The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. All outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, and the  cinematography is claustrophobic. A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Independence Day\n",
      "📝 Summary: The 1996 sci-fi action blockbuster is one of the greatest of all time. Will Smith fights invading aliens, and Jeff Goldblum is annoyingly smart.\n",

      "Movies similar to 'Avatar' using KNN Sentiment:\n",
      "🔸 Title: Sausage Party\n",
      "📝 Summary: The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Cars\n",
      "📝 Summary: 'Cars' is very good Disney, not quite in the upper echelons of their releases but certainly close. Owen Wilson is terrific as Lightning McQueen, while Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable Guy give noteworthy performances as Sally and Mater.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Now You See Me 2\n",
      "📝 Summary: \"Now You See Me 2\" is one of the rare instances where the sequel is actually better than the original. The Four Horsemen are back, this time fighting the powers that be with even greater illusions.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n",
      "📝 Summary: Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can. Director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Cutthroat Island\n",
      "📝 Summary: Not as bad as it's notoriously condemned as being, but still clearly shows that both leads and the director were ill-advised. Davis brings her A-game and definitely tries her best but this just isn't her thing. Modine's clearly not blockbuster star material for action films.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Dr. No\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Spy Who Loved Me\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Casino Royale\n",
      "📝 Summary: In 2006, the film makers - no longer under the watchful eye of the late Cubby Broccoli decided to run away from making James Bond movies. They screwed with the gun barrel and the tone of the once lively, over the top and amusing series was now one of tedium. It's all over for Bond films now unless they decide to make real Bond films again.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Die Another Day\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n",

      "🔸 Title: Batman Begins\n",
      "📝 Summary: Director Christopher Nolan goes back to Batman origins to spark it into a sort of triumphant homecoming. Gone is all forms of camp veneer so evident in Joel Schumacher's offerings. In place we have a darkly rich picture intent on fleshing out Batman's motives, and crucially, his fractured persona.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Batman Forever\n",
      "📝 Summary: Batman takes on a new side kick as he fights to keep Gotham City out of the clutches of Two-Face and The Riddler. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Insurgent\n",
      "📝 Summary: This movie has quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie. The plot is, well, mediocre.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n",
      "📝 Summary: I believe that we should call it a modernism show, albeit exhibited in the form of a movie. There are many great predictions hinting to future (it is from 1968 - can you believe it?) innovations throughout the movie.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Sahara\n",
      "📝 Summary: This was a weird attempt created a 2005 version of Indiana Jones. Decent watch, might watch again, but can't recommend unless you're running out of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Men in Black\n",
      "📝 Summary: An athletic New York City police officer (Will Smith) joins a shadowy government organization that deals with extraterrestrial interactions on Earth. Tommy Lee Jones plays his senior partner, Rip Torn the head of the agency, Vincent D'Onofrio a possessed hick and Linda Fiorentino an attractive coronor. The film is wildly amusing in the first half, but loses its energy a bit in the last act.\n",

      "\n",
      "Movies similar to 'Spider-Man 3' using KMeans Sentiment:\n",
      "🔸 Title: Spider-Man\n",
      "📝 Summary: So many Spiderman movies out there but this will always be the original. Though the other ones have better CGI and maybe action sequences, none can match the plot this one has. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire the real MVP!\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Amazing Spider-Man\n",
      "📝 Summary: \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" has no reason to exist. This movie simply wasn't needed\"\n",

      "Movies similar to 'Spider-Man 3' using KNN Sentiment:\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Amazing Spider-Man 2\n",
      "📝 Summary: Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Spider-Man 2\n",
      "📝 Summary: Tragically I am a Batman. An obsessive Caped Crusader comic-book collector until 1972 when my evil mother tossed the entire bunch in the garbage. Despite Nolan's recent attempts (and questionable sincerity), the best Batman movie hasn't been made yet. I await thee Dark Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Eight Legged Freaks\n",
      "📝 Summary: Eight Legged Freaks is unashamedly homaging B movie creature features from the 1950s. The likes of Tarantula and Them! have their Pedipalps well and truly watered.\n",

      "\n",
      "Movies similar to 'Tangled' using KMeans Sentiment:\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Princess and the Frog\n",
      "📝 Summary: The plot was a tad predictable and the moral seemed to meander some. The most unique thing were the character types. Some of the human facial expressions were just off enough to be slightly creepy. I am glad most of the movie had some of the main characters as animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Princess Bride\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Princess Bride is ultimately a story of love - of a grandather for his grandson, of Inigo Montoya for his murdered father and between Buttercup and Wesley. The characters are endearing and essential to the plot. The only criticism I have is that it is too male centric as many films and series still are unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Aladdin\n",
      "📝 Summary: Aladdin is one of Disney’s most adored classics. Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it's the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of the best.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Captain America: Civil War\n",
      "📝 Summary: The pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences. Two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Captain America: The Winter Soldier\n",
      "📝 Summary: This is indeed a great piece of superhero entertainment. If superheroes and action, plenty of action, is within your sphere of interest then this movie truly delivers. There is even a story to support the stunts and special effects fireworks.\n",

      "Movies similar to 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' using KNN Sentiment:\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Maze Runner\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Thor\n",
      "📝 Summary: Thor has only been out for a week and a half, and already it’s grossed $100 million! Pretty fucking good considering it hasn’t even been released in America yet. The movie was not great. It was mostly talking and I don't understand half of what the actors were saying. I should watch this with subtitles next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: RoboCop\n",
      "📝 Summary: There are some good parts in the movie and, of course, the special effects are more up to todays standards. However it lacks a lot of the appeal, the over the top gory violence and the cartoonish wow-factor that the original has.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Final Destination 5\n",
      "📝 Summary:  FD5 has garnered mixed reactions, but even allowing for the fact that as an idea it's a series that can't get better, part 5 is a considerable step up from the very poor part 4. The disaster that underpins the formula is one of the best to be staged, a mighty bridge collapse that terrifies and thrills in equal measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Swingers\n",
      "📝 Summary: The plot revolves around three friends, aspiring actors, who seek to make it in challenging Los Angeles. The film targets a niche audience that I don't find myself in: single men, somewhat bitter and dissatisfied, misogynists and womanizers.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\n",
      "📝 Summary: Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source.

      "🔸 Title: Skyfall\n",
      "📝 Summary: Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie, it was one of my all time favourites. Unlike Quantum of Solace, I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Dr. No\n",
      "📝 Summary: \"An extraordinary manifesto for not just the longest-running film series to date, but for an entire genre. Long may Sir Connery live--the enjoyment his work has given me over the years is inestimable!\"\n",

      "🔸 Title: Casino Royale\n",
      "📝 Summary: In 2006, the film makers - no longer under the watchful eye of the late Cubby Broccoli decided to run away from making James Bond movies. They screwed with the gun barrel and the tone of the once lively, over the top and amusing series was now one of tedium. It's all over for Bond films now unless they decide to make real Bond films again.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Patriot Games\n",
      "📝 Summary: The acting on show is more than adequate, Harrison Ford is great in the role of Jack Ryan. Anne Archer is solid enough as the wife and mother caught up in the web of nastiness unfolding. The baddies are led by the brooding Sean Bean who is a little under written, whilst Richard Harris is sadly underused.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: 16 Blocks\n",
      "📝 Summary: Bruce Willis and Mos Def double up well as Jack and Eddie. I particularly like Willis' look for the majority of the film. David Morse, meanwhile, makes for an OK villain.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Jack the Giant Slayer\n",
      "📝 Summary: The giants are very well done. CGI is good to very good most of the time. The acting is generally not so good and sometimes downright abysmal. Boring and with low quality animations.\n",

      "📝 Summary: Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can. Director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Captain Phillips\n",
      "📝 Summary: This film is well-crafted and tense procedural about a true story. I took it as a meditation on powerlessness. There's a shipping crew that is easily sought out by pirates, and there are the pirates that ultimately fail.\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!\n",

      "🔸 Title: Meet the Deedles\n",
      "📝 Summary: Paul Walker and co-star Steve Van Wormer play their ridiculous roles well. Their characters are cringey surf 'dudes' - they come across as intended. The other characters and subplot is indeed terrible.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Wild Wild West\n",
      "📝 Summary: For all its many failings, there is some verve and swagger, excitement, Will Smith's likability and some splendid gadgets. I say chill out with a beer, turn the home cinema speakers up and just roll with it, because thinking about it too deeply could possibly make you angry... 5/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Expendables 2\n",
      "📝 Summary: This is a movie that you watch for two things and two things only, the action and seeing your old favourite macho-guys on the screen again. For me, it was mostly the action since some of these old guys are really…well…getting old. At least Stallone, Dolph and “Schwarzy” starts to get well past the best before date for these type of roles.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Cutthroat Island\n",
      "📝 Summary: Not as bad as it's notoriously condemned as being, but still clearly shows that both leads and the director were ill-advised. Davis brings her A-game and definitely tries her best but this just isn't her thing. Modine's clearly not blockbuster star material for action films.\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Call\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Call is one of those infuriating thriller movies that destroys all its hard work with a lame last quarter.

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Fantastic Four\n",

      "🔸 Title: Batman & Robin\n",
      "📝 Summary: 'Batman & Robin' is fun to laugh at. It's terrible, God is it terrible, but it's terrible in that right kind of way. Clooney was actually a pretty inspired choice if you're thinking solely about the billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne.\n",

      "📝 Summary: Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man.\n",

At 2½ hours this really does feel like you could have actually built one of the pyramids in the time it takes to come to what is the inevitable tee for another sequel.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Fantastic Four\n",

      "🔸 Title: Return to Oz\n",

      "🔸 Title: Rango\n",
      "📝 Summary: 'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy.

      "🔸 Title: Spider-Man\n",
      "📝 Summary: So many Spiderman movies out there but this will always be the original. Though the other ones have better CGI and maybe action sequences, none can match the plot this one has. I've always been able to relate to Peter Parker growing up. Tobey Maguire the real MVP!\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Insurgent\n",
      "📝 Summary: This movie has quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie. The plot is, well, mediocre.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Big Fish\n",
      "📝 Summary: First time seeing this since probably 2003 in theaters and it's absolutely heartfelt and charming, probably one of Tim Burton's best films. Great performances all around but especially Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney. Really well done. **4.5/5**\n",

      "📝 Summary: The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Gravity\n",
      "📝 Summary: Alfonso Cuarón is a real titan and Sandra Bullock goes for the Oscar. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Toy Story 3\n",
      "📝 Summary: Just like any other Pixar movies, Toy Story 3 was great. The story flowed really well with the two Toy Story movies. It was funny, has a lot of action and adventure, and it was really touching.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Buried\n",
      "📝 Summary: Despite the fact that there are quite a few plot holes in this quite tautly put together drama, Ryan Reynolds might actually have turned in one of the best performances of his career, here. Only a perfect screenplay can make the film Adrenalinic and not annoying, as of course the set is on few square mq2 !\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Change-Up\n",
      "📝 Summary: This is probably my favorite \"body swap\" trope movie. It's Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman for crying out loud. The production value is clearly there, though I think most of it went into locations and cast budgets.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Get Smart\n",
      "📝 Summary: Steve Carrell is in his sweet spot with all kinds of physical comedy and side-splitting sarcasm. Anne Hathaway was an excellent partner reacting to Carrell's nonsense with many of her own clever moments. The movie honored the show's spirit while increasing the budget, effects, and laughs.\n",

      "📝 Summary: 'Toy Story 2' still manages to create the same magic that the original has - which is mightily impressive. It, at least to me, has less humour but what it loses there it makes up for in the premise, which is arguably more interesting when compared to the 1995 film.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Monsters University\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\n",

      "📝 Summary: The Terminator is a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. The effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984.\n",

Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom’s babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang. The over-the-top action is akin to “The Road Warrior” ( 1981)\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: 2 Fast 2 Furious\n",
      "📝 Summary: Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson team-up to bring down a pompous drug lord in south Florida. The story is weak, but are we really looking for some brains over brawn here? We want car porn and we want it now!\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Mad Max\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\n",
      "📝 Summary: It's a good honest Star Trek story, it beats a real emotive heart. Some may decry the lack of blistering space battles, or end of the universe peril scenarios. On its own terms this stands up as one of the better character pieces in the series.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: Star Trek: Generations\n",

      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Finest Hours\n",

      "📝 Summary: The Princess Bride is ultimately a story of love - of a grandather for his grandson, of Inigo Montoya for his murdered father and between Buttercup and Wesley. The characters are endearing and essential to the plot. The only criticism I have is that it is too male centric as many films and series still are unfortunately.\n",

      "📝 Summary: 'Bridge to Terabithia' is just short of being anything more than good, but I go away from viewing it in a much more touched state than I would've predicted at the midway point.

      "📝 Summary: Based on  Louisa May Alcott’s classic 1868 novel, “Little Women’ details the coming-of-age years of four sisters from 1862-1868. The story curiously isn’t as compelling as the classic 1933 version with Katharine Hepburn, at least as I REMEMBER it being. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half when the forceful Jo (Winona Ryder) goes to New York City and develops a friendship with an amicable, but much older scholar (Gabriel Byrne).

      "📝 Summary: This is an excellent movie with a great cast. One of the characters is truly over the top, but not slapstick. This film won't move you like Slumdog Millionaire but it is a quality film in its own right.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\n",
      "📝 Summary: Angelina Jolie was born to play this role and nailed the look and strength of Lara Croft. This movie brought the 2000s-era Tomb Raider games to life with all the style and camp of the decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 Title: The Princess Bride\n",
      "📝 Summary: The Princess Bride is ultimately a story of love - of a grandather for his grandson, of Inigo Montoya for his murdered father and between Buttercup and Wesley. The characters are endearing and essential to the plot. The only criticism I have is that it is too male centric as many films and series still are unfortunately.\n",

      "🔸 Title: The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\n",
      "📝 Summary: 'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian' is a suitably entertaining production, if not an exceptional one; though it's not far off. I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summer-like conditions means the film does lose some spark. A definitive downgrade on the first film, but this sequel still entertains to a good level.\n",

      "📝 Summary: This is such outstandingly fun. It's so unique a cinematic experience. Director Milius has a fine feel for the swords-and-sandals/fantasy worldscape. An excellent and underrated supporting cast is here at well to help Arnie out.\n",

      "🔸 Title: Rango\n",
      "📝 Summary: 'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy. The film starts off absolutely hilariously, with an accident, half a road kill and a journey through the desert. After meeting a lovely lizard named Beans, he ends up in the small town of Dirt.\n",
